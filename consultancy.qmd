I regularly act as consultant on clinical, public health and industry projects (e.g. Smart Peak Flow Ltd, Adia Health Ltd). For example, in 2019, as part of the 'Research to Venture Mental Health Programme' funded by the Wellcome Trust (UK), I worked with Adia Health Ltd (now transformed into <a href="https://myparla.com/">Parla</a>) to conduct a mixed-methods pilot evaluation of a digital platform to support women's physical and mental preconception health.

I serve as unpaid scientific advisor for digital health companies including the <a href="https://smokefreeapp.com/">Smoke Free app</a>, <a href="https://www.turn.io/">Turn</a> and the pre-print platform <a href="https://www.qeios.com/teaser">Qeios</a>.

*Please feel free to contact me regarding potential consultancies.*
