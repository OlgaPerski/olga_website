Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in Europe and beyond. Gold standard treatment for smoking cessation includes pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. However, smoking lapses – influenced by momentary fluctuations in cigarette availability, stress, and cravings – are a key source of treatment failure. COMPLAPSE aims to advance the state-of-the-art by developing and validating a dynamic systems model of lapse risk, improving the precision of static behaviour change theories to account for observed complexities and laying the foundation for dynamically tailored, person-centred digital smoking cessation interventions for increased effectiveness. COMPLAPSE is interdisciplinary in scope – drawing on know-how from behavioural science, engineering, and computer science – and directly contributes to Europe’s Path to the Digital Decade and its Strategic Framework for the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases. 

First, a conceptual model will be developed by articulating a diverse group of stakeholders’ (i.e., researchers, policymakers, practitioners, smokers) dynamic predictions through participatory systems mapping. Next, a computational model will be developed through formulating mathematical equations for each model component, followed by a series of computer simulations to iteratively refine the model to align with stakeholders’ predictions. Finally, the model will be validated against temporally dense experience sampling and sensor data collected in smokers’ daily lives across different geographies to critically examine whether the computational model outperforms state-of-the-art behaviour change theories.

COMPLAPSE is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON), Grant No. 101065293 (PI: Dr. Olga Perski). COMPLAPSE is supported by Prof. Nelli Hankonen (Tampere University), Prof. Eric Hekler (University of California, San Diego) and Prof. Misha Pavel (Northeastern University).

The data and analytical code underpinning the analyses in COMPLAPSE will be made openly available via GitHub in due course.
