During my post-doctoral training (2018-2022), I worked closely with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/jamie-brown">Prof. Jamie Brown</a> and colleagues to examine the cross-sectional and prospective associations of psychological factors such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460318302764?via%3Dihub">perceived addiction to smoking</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460318300509?via%3Dihub"> consistent motivation to stop</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268447">smoking to relieve stress</a> and <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01565-2">harm perceptions<a/> with smoking/drinking status, quit attempts, the adoption of particular aids (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871619304302?via%3Dihub">digital tools</a>, e-cigarettes) and quit success in the <a href="https://smokinginengland.info/graphs/top-line-findings">Smoking and Alcohol Toolkit Studies</a> (a series of representative household surveys in England).
