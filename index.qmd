I'm an interdisciplinary researcher and practitioner health psychologist working at the intersection of behavioural science and technology. My research is focused on the development, optimisation and evaluation of interventions for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction delivered via <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-511/v2">smartphone apps<a/>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2055207619880676">chatbots</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000060">virtual reality<a/>. I'm interested in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/tbm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/tbm/ibaa026/5838784">technology-enabled, real-time assessment and modelling of within-person processes</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34514668/">‘just-in-time adaptive interventions’.</a> 

I'm an advocate of Open Science. I act as Co-Director for the <a href="https://www.opendigitalhealth.org/">Open Digital Health initiative</a>, which aims to enable the scaling and sharing of evidence-informed digital health tools.

<h3>Brief bio</h3>

I completed my PhD in Health Psychology at University College London (UK) in 2018, with a <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10063428/">thesis</a> focused on the definition, measurement and promotion of user engagement with digital behaviour change interventions.

After completing my PhD, I worked as a Research Fellow (2018-2021) and subsequently as a Senior Research Fellow (2021-2022) in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/behavioural-science-and-health/research/ucl-tobacco-alcohol-research-group-utarg">UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group</a> (UK). 

In 2022, I was awarded a 3-year <a href="https://msca-net.eu/scientific-community/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-pf/">MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship</a> funded by the European Commission to work on the [COMPLAPSE]({{< ref "/ongoing-projects/complapse/index.md" >}} "COMPLAPSE") project. During my fellowship, I will spend two years in the <a href="https://hwsph.ucsd.edu/">Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science</a> at the University of California, San Diego (USA) and one year in the <a href="https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/faculty-social-sciences">Faculty of Social Sciences<a/> at Tampere University (Finland).
