I regularly contribute to health policy formation, including service on expert academic panels.

In 2020-2022, I co-led an evidence review written for the UK Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which was subsequently used to inform Public Health England’s (PHE) statement on smoking and COVID-19. PHE subsequently requested that the RCP review be converted into a <a href="https://www.qeios.com/read/UJR2AW.15">living review</a>. The review was updated 12 times, with the manuscript shared with PHE’s ‘tobacco and smoking cell’ directly and updated on a preprint server (with v7 published in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.15276">peer-reviewed journal</a>). PHE referred to the review in response to a parliamentary question on smoking and COVID-19.

In 2021, I was invited alongside members of the UK SPI-B to provide expert input into the development of the UK coronavirus contact tracing app.

In addition, I have contributed to health and technology policy formation by leading the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change’s submission to NICE’s consultation in preparation for updating their <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng183">guideline on behaviour change to incorporate evidence on digital behaviour change interventions</a>. In 2019, I provided academic stakeholder input into NICE’s <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/evidence-standards-framework-for-digital-health-technologies">Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies</a>. In 2020, I was invited to provide input into the WHO–ITU mHealth Hub in EU’s <a href="https://mhealth-hub.org/download/d2-1-knowledge-tool-1-health-apps-assessment-frameworks">‘Knowledge Tool 1: Assessment Frameworks in mHealth’</a>.
