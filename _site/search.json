    "text": "Photo by Unsplash\n\n\n\nCigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in Europe and beyond. Gold standard treatment for smoking cessation includes pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. However, smoking lapses – influenced by momentary fluctuations in cigarette availability, stress, and cravings – are a key source of treatment failure. COMPLAPSE aims to advance the state-of-the-art by developing and validating a dynamic computational model of lapse risk, improving the precision of static behaviour change theories to account for observed complexities and laying the foundation for dynamically tailored, person-centred digital smoking cessation interventions for increased effectiveness. COMPLAPSE is interdisciplinary in scope – drawing on know-how from behavioural science, engineering, and computer science – and directly contributes to Europe’s Path to the Digital Decade and its Strategic Framework for the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases.\nCOMPLAPSE is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON), Grant No. 101065293 (PI: Dr. Olga Perski; Co-Is: Prof. Nelli Hankonen, Prof. Eric Hekler and Prof. Misha Pavel).\nMore specifically, COMPLAPSE aims to:\n\nDevelop a conceptual model of lapse risk, drawing on knowledge of the available literature and stakeholder input (addressed in WP1);\nFormulate mathematical equations for the components of the conceptual model and perform a series of computer simulations within the R environment (addressed in WP2);\nCollect EMA and sensor data and use this to validate the expert-derived computational model (addressed in WP3).\n\nSee Figure 1 for an overview of the WPs within COMPLAPSE.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Gantt chart of the WPs, tasks, deliverables and milestones within COMPLAPSE.\n\n\n\n\nWP1\nDrawing on knowledge of the extant literature (including a recent systematic review and meta-analysis), the core project team will iteratively develop a prototype conceptual model using Lucidchart. Next, stakeholders (i.e., collaborators, consultants and participants) will be invited to critique and add to (or remove from) the prototype conceptual model through a series of virtual focus groups, inspired by participatory systems mapping methodology (Barbrook-Johnson & Penn, 2021). Stakeholders will be invited to co-author the resulting paper(s). However, as co-authorship is not necessarily beneficial for all stakeholder groups, consultants and participants will also receive a €20 voucher as remuneration for their time and effort.\nWe aim to involve the following stakeholder groups:\nCollaborators: Scientific researchers or policymakers/tobacco control experts working across universities, research institutes, government or not-for-profit organisations specialising in behaviour change theory, smoking cessation, or computational modelling (n=6);\nConsultants: Policymakers/tobacco control experts working across government and not-for-profit organisations or stop smoking practitioners working across dedicated stop smoking services or general medical practice, with a particular focus on consultants with experience of working with smokers with specific needs, such as smokers with mental health problems (n=6);\nParticipants: Adult, daily smokers interested in quitting (n=6).\nStakeholders will be eligible to take part if they are aged 18+ years and are a fluent English speaker. People who declare a financial or non-financial tie with the tobacco industry are not eligible to take part.\nTo enable exploration of how factors at multiple systems levels (e.g., neighbourhood-, city-, and country-level factors) influence lapse risk trajectories for different individuals, we aim to recruit stakeholders (and subsequently collect empirical data) across several geographies. As the lead researcher is based in the United States (San Diego, California) and Finland (Tampere) for the duration of the project and is affiliated with a university in the United Kingdom (London) – with networks and resources for data collection in these locations – these countries/cities will be used as case studies.\nStakeholders will be recruited through the core project team’s networks and social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook). At least 50% of smokers recruited will be from lower socioeconomic position (SEP) groups – defined as having no post-16 educational qualifications – and an equal proportion of women and men will be recruited. E-mails outlining the purpose and procedure for the participatory systems mapping activity will be sent in batches until the target for each stakeholder group is met.\nWithin each virtual focus group session (2-4 people, to accommodate time zone differences and availability), stakeholders will be asked to critique and add to the prototype conceptual model developed by the core project team. For example, stakeholders will be asked if they think any key components are missing (or should be removed) and ideas for how to differently represent the system dynamics. Field notes will be taken and findings from each focus group will be integrated and translated into a table with information about the expected direction, magnitude, and rate of change of the model components. The participatory systems mapping approach does not guarantee the identification of an exhaustive range of factors that influence the system dynamics. However, it is a well-established method for challenging mental models and ensuring that a wide range of perspectives are considered and represented in the research. The conceptual model will serve as a starting point for the development of the computational model in WP2.\n\n\nWP2\nNext, mathematical equations (e.g., difference or differential equations) will be formulated for each component in the conceptual model and translated into R code to align with the expert-derived domain-specific knowledge, including equations which are treated as deterministic and those that require probabilistic elements (e.g., the probability of experiencing a stressful event or encountering a smoking cue). Drawing on the table developed in WP1, initial parameter values for the computational model will be selected and simulations will be run in the R environment. A series of sensitivity analyses will be conducted with different starting conditions for the model parameters until the output resembles expected behaviour for different ‘archetypes’ of smokers, including, for example, a smoker who quickly relapses, and a smoker who initially lapses but subsequently bounces back to abstinence. The change in the variance explained will be systematically explored by ignoring (i.e., fixing at their mean value) key model components. This will help understand and calibrate each contributing source of uncertainty. The model output will be visualised in the R environment using time series plots. Stakeholders will be invited to provide feedback on the model output.\n\n\nWP3\nNext, EMA and sensor data will be collected to validate the computational model. Participants will be recruited via social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook). Eligibility criteria will include being an adult, daily smoker who i) owns a smartphone, ii) is willing to make a quit attempt, and iii) is willing to respond to regular EMAs and wear a sensor for the duration of the study (to be determined following the results from WPs 1-2). At least 50% of smokers will be recruited from lower socioeconomic position groups and an equal proportion of women and men will be recruited.\nEligible participants will be asked to download an EMA application onto their smartphone and will be provided with a recently validated wearable sensor with suitable functionality. Given substantial evidence that unaided smoking cessation attempts have low odds of success (Raupach et al., 2013), participants will receive brief, evidence-based behavioural support. Throughout the study, participants will be asked to complete brief EMAs multiple times per day in response to random prompts, in addition to self-initiated (i.e., event-contingent) ‘lapse’ EMAs. The questionnaire items and the variables derived from the sensor data (e.g., heart rate variability, geolocation tracking) – and their respective sampling frequency (e.g., day, hour, minute) – will correspond to the expert-derived computational model developed in WPs 1-2. The questionnaire items and sensor data will be designed to capture factors such as cravings, self-regulatory skills (operationalised as high heart rate variability – considered an indicator of autonomic nervous system regulation (Holzman & Bridgett, 2017) – and measured with the wearable sensor), motivation to stop, and cigarette availability. Where possible, validated questionnaires will be used. As social desirability bias may lead some participants to falsely report being abstinent via the self-reported EMAs, we will follow the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco’s (SRNT) recommendation to use biochemical verification to distinguish smokers from non-smokers. Exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) is a valid and reliable indicator of recent smoke absorption from combustible tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes, cigars) and does not capture the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (e.g., e-cigarettes). Participants will be asked to provide an eCO reading at the end of the study period. SRNT recommends using cut-offs of 8-10 parts per million for distinguishing smokers from non-smokers.\nA head-to-head comparison of the predictive power – operationalised as the variance accounted for in the output variable or the R2 – of the computational model with a set of simpler models informed by current state-of-the-art theories, such as Social Cognitive Theory, will be performed.\n\n\nDissemination\nThis website will be used for dissemination of findings from project COMPLAPSE, including scientific publications, talks, blog entries/’vlogs’, workshops and podcasts."

    "text": "During the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022), I co-led a living review (updated 12 times, with version 7 published in a peer-reviewed journal) of evidence on the association of smoking status with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality. Each update was shared directly with Public Health England’s tobacco control team and the charitable organisation Action on Smoking & Health. We found that compared with never smokers, current smokers appeared to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased risk of greater in-hospital disease severity, while former smokers appeared to be at increased risk of hospitalisation, greater in-hospital disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal.\nI co-led a case-control study at a UK hospital site to examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous. We found that in a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR-medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.\nI also contributed to a large survey study to gain a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on smoking, vaping and alcohol consumption among UK adults. We found that among UK adults, self-reported diagnosed/suspected COVID-19 was not associated with vaping status. Half of current vapers reported changing their vaping consumption since the COVID-19 outbreak, with the majority reporting an increase, and a minority was motivated to quit due to COVID-19.\nI also led a rapid review and meta-analysis of interventions to increase personal protective behaviours to limit the spread of respiratory viruses. We identified 39 studies conducted across 15 countries. We found low-quality evidence for positive effects of interventions targeting hand hygiene, with unclear results for interventions targeting face mask use. There was a lack of evidence for most behaviours of interest within this review.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Unsplash"

    "text": "The aim of the EMASENS study is to develop a smartphone-based stop smoking tool which provides personalised support to smokers in real-time, when they most need it (i.e., a ‘just-in-time adaptive intervention’). To provide such personalised support, we first need to understand when to send support and what type of support to send. \n\n\n\nPhoto by Unsplash\n\n\n\nIn the first stage of the EMASENS study, we aim to gain a better understanding of when and why people are at risk of lapsing (i.e., smoking cigarettes after the quit date). To build a lapse prediction algorithm, we will triangulate findings from two studies using slightly different approaches.\nIn the first study, we used observational data from a popular smoking cessation app to develop supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse reports. We used data from app users with ≥20 unprompted data entries, which included information about craving severity, mood, activity, social context, and lapse incidence. A series of group-level supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained and tested. Their ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample i) observations and ii) individuals were evaluated. Next, a series of individual-level and hybrid algorithms were trained and tested. We found that using unprompted app data appeared feasible for constructing a high-performing group-level lapse classification algorithm but its performance was variable when applied to unseen individuals. Algorithms trained on each individual’s dataset, in addition to hybrid algorithms trained on the group plus a proportion of each individual’s data, had improved performance but could only be constructed for a minority of participants. We therefore deemed it important to repeat the analyses using data from a prompted study design (using both signal- and event-contingent Ecological Momentary Assessments), with results triangulated with those from the present study to arrive at a better understanding of when and why lapses occur.\nThe second study, for which data collection is currently ongoing (estimated completion in December 2022), is a longitudinal, observational study of prompted psychological data and passive digital biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability, step count) with repeated outcome measures of lapse incidence within individuals across a 10-day quit attempt. Smokers will be eligible to participate if they: i) are aged 18+ years; ii) smoke cigarettes regularly; iii) reside in London and are willing to visit University College London twice before and after the 10-day study period; iv) own a smartphone capable of running the required study smartphone apps (i.e., Android 8.0 or up; iOS 14.0 or up); v) are willing to set a quit date within 7 days from their initial study visit (preferably the next day to capitalise on their motivation to stop); vi) are willing to wear a Fitbit and respond to hourly surveys for a period of 10 days during regular waking hours; vii) have internet/Wi-Fi access for the duration of the study; and viii) are able and willing to provide an exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) measure (e.g., people with a diagnosis of asthma or COPD sometimes find it difficult to provide eCO measures). Smokers will not be eligible to participate if they: i) have a known history of arrythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation), ii) are regularly taking beta blockers (e.g., atenolol, bisoprolol), or iii) have an implanted cardiac rhythm device. During the 10-day study period, participants will receive 16 hourly prompts per day via the m-Path app (i.e., signal-contingent sampling), scheduled within their usual waking hours (e.g., a participant who indicates that they typically wake up at 7am will receive hourly prompts from 7am to 10pm). Each survey will take 2-3 minutes to complete. Responses will be time stamped and interactions need to be completed within 30 minutes. Participants will also be asked to record lapses as and when they occur (i.e., event-contingent sampling) via an in-app button. To promote EMA adherence, participants will be sent regular e-mails with updates on their compliance rate and screenshots of graphs of their survey responses (e.g., cravings, affect), which are automatically generated by the m-Path software.\nThe key output from the first stage of the EMASENS study will be the selection of an overall best-performing algorithm to take forwards to underpin a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI).\nFollowing the development of the lapse prediction algorithm, in the second stage of the project, we will develop the intervention messages using theory and behaviour change tools (e.g., the Behaviour Change Wheel) in combination with extensive user testing. A bank of intervention messages will be developed, tailored to each identified lapse risk factor and ranked by potential users. Next, the effectiveness of the JITAI will be evaluated in an RCT. This work will form part of Corinna Leppin’s PhD project."

In collaboration with an international team of researchers (Dr. Dominika Kwasnicka, Dr. Jan Keller, Dr. Dimitra Kale, Bernard Yeboah-Asiamah Asare, Verena Schneider, Daniel Powell, Felix Naughton, Gill ten Hoor, Peter Verboon), I co-led a large systematic review of EMA studies of five public health-related behaviours, including tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, dietary behaviour and sexual health behaviour. The study protocol was pre-registered and the data and R code are openly available via GitHub.\nWe included 633 studies. The median study duration was 14 days. The most frequently assessed predictors were ‘negative feeling states’ (21%) and ‘motivation and goals’ (16.5%). The pooled percentage of EMA adherence was high at 81.4% (95% CI = 80.0%, 82.8%, k = 348) and did not differ by target behaviour but was somewhat higher in student (vs. general population) samples, when EMAs were delivered via mobile phones/smartphones (vs. handheld devices), and when event contingent (vs. fixed) sampling was used. This review showcases how the EMA method has been applied to improve understanding and prediction of health behaviours in context.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this large, overarching review, a series of behaviour-specific sub-reviews have also been planned/completed. I led the sub-review focused on tobacco smoking. More specifically, we examined within-person associations between psychological and contextual factors and lapse incidence in smokers attempting to stop. We included 56 studies, with 18 studies contributing 1+ effect sizes to the meta-analyses. In smokers attempting to stop, environmental and social cues and cravings appear to be key within-person antecedents of smoking lapse incidence."

    "text": "I first became interested in the problem of engagement with digital behaviour change interventions when studying for an MSc in Health Psychology at UCL (2014-2015). In my dissertation, I explored patterns of users’ engagement with a novel smoking cessation app, BupaQuit.\nMy PhD thesis (2015-2018) - supervised by Prof. Susan Michie, Prof. Ann Blandford and Prof. Robert West - comprised 6 studies and aimed to gain a better understanding of how to define, measure and promote engagement with digital interventions in general, and with apps for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction in particular. As part of this work, we conducted an interdisciplinary, systematic review and generated a two-part, integrative definition of digital engagement and a conceptual framework. We used semi-structured interviews and online surveys to develop a self-report measure of digital engagement and evaluated the new measure in two different populations. We also conducted a think aloud and interview study and a focus group study to gain a better understanding of factors that influence engagement with apps for smoking cessation alcohol reduction, in addition to a series of N-of-1 studies, harnessing smartphone-enabled daily ecological momentary assessments, to explore within-person fluctuations in psychological and behavioural variables (e.g. motivation, extent of alcohol consumption) and their associations with users’ app engagement.\n\n\n\nRelated to this work, in collaboration with Prof. Jonathan Bricker (Fred Hutch Cancer Center) and colleagues, we explored patterns of user engagement with websites and apps for smoking cessation, using unsupervised machine learning techniques including sequence and cluster analysis. For example, we found that WebQuit users could be categorized into Disengagers, Tryers, and Committers based on their qualitatively different content usage patterns. Committers saw increases in a key mechanism of action and had greater odds of quit success.\nIn a piece collaboratively written with Dr. Camille Short (University of Melbourne), we reflected on the concept of acceptability in digital health research and how it relates to user engagement. We conducted a narrative review of theoretical and empirical examples from the literature. First, we argue that acceptability may usefully be considered an emergent property of a complex, adaptive system of interacting components (e.g., affective attitude, beliefs), which in turn influences (and is influenced by) user engagement. Second, acceptability is important due to its ability to predict and explain key outcomes of interest, including user engagement and intervention effectiveness. Third, precisely what people find acceptable is deeply contextualized and interlinked with prevailing social and cultural norms. Understanding and designing for such norms (e.g., through drawing on principles of user centered design) is therefore key. Finally, there is a lack of standard acceptability measures and thresholds. Star ratings coupled with free-text responses may provide a pragmatic means of capturing acceptability.\nFollowing this work, I’ve become increasingly persuaded that emerging technologies (e.g. chatbots, virtual reality) and novel intervention designs (e.g. hybrid human-digital interventions, ‘just-in-time adaptive interventions’) have potential for counteracting the observed ‘engagement crisis’. In collaboration with Dr. David Crane (architect of the Smoke Free app), we conducted an experimental study with >55,000 smokers to examine the added effect of a supportive chatbot on user engagement and short-term quit success. The results were positive, with the addition of the chatbot more than doubling rates of engagement and increasing self-reported quit success at a 1-month follow-up. Together with Alice Alphonse and Kezia Stewart (MSc Behaviour Change, UCL), we subsequently conducted a qualitative study to explore the potential mechanism(s) underpinning this increased user engagement. We found that anthropomorphism of the quick-response chatbot appeared to be enabled by its interaction style and format and users’ perceived need for support, which may have given rise to feelings of accountability and increased engagement."

    "text": "The Open Digital Health (ODH) initiative is a not-for-profit organisation that encourages health scientists, practitioners and technology developers to share and reuse open digital health tools.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the ODH initiative, and in close collaboration with Dr. Gjalt-Jorn Peters (The Open University of the Netherlands), I’m co-leading the development of a living review and database of digital health tools. Tools to support health promotion are increasingly developed using digital technologies, allowing them to be more dynamic and situated than was possible with older media and facilitating reuse of tool components. At the same time, opportunities for reuse are limited by tools being insufficiently documented, findable, accessible, interoperable, or licensed insufficiently permissively. To avoid waste of public funds, it would be beneficial if there were an open, public database of digital health tools. This would help researchers, prevention professionals, policymakers, and healthcare workers to identify available technologies and explore the evidence for their effectiveness. To populate a first version of such a database, we will conduct a living review of digital health tools.\nDeciding which entities to extract and how each entity will be extracted (e.g., categories, coding instructions) is an important first step in developing this living review. Given the weight of this decision, combined with the multidisciplinary nature of the review topic, it is important to base the decision on expertise from a wide range of scientific disciplines (e.g., behavioural science, computer science, human-computer interaction) and geographic regions. Therefore, we will use a procedure that combines elements of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and the Delphi method to leverage expertise from a group of experts and transparently base the decisions on this information. This approach combines the best of two worlds: asynchronous pooling of expertise and a transparent and systematic decision procedure.\nWe will use successive rounds where the “participants” (i.e., expert collaborators) provide information, interact with information prepared beforehand or provided in earlier rounds, and provide ratings. The procedure for deciding which entities to extract has been pre-registered.\nThe results from the project (publicised after each consecutive round) are openly available on GitLab."

    "title": "Virtual Reality for Smokers Unmotivated to Stop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Individual-level interventions for smokers unmotivated to quit remain scarce and have had limited success. Little is known about the potential of virtual reality (VR) for delivering messaging to smokers unmotivated to quit. VR refers to the creation of a digital environment that has the potential to evoke strong sensory experiences, accessed through increasingly widespread technologies such as head-mounted displays.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Unsplash\n\n\n\nWe (Dr. Olga Perski, Dr. Dimitra Kale, Prof. Jamie Brown) helped develop a brief VR scenario – suited for delivery in smokers’ own homes and accessible via commercially available head-mounted displays without involving a joystick – grounded in the Extended Parallel Process Model. Following user testing but prior to conducting a large-scale randomised controlled trial, we considered it important to conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of recruitment and acceptability of the VR scenario. Although the target sample size was not achieved within our feasibility window, an amendment to gift inexpensive headsets via post appeared feasible. The brief VR scenario appeared acceptable to smokers unmotivated to quit; however, we concluded that future work would benefit from optimising the VR scenario prior to conducting a larger-scale study.\nTosan Okpako joined the project in October 2022. As part of her PhD, Tosan will lead the development of an immersive VR scenario to increase motivation in smokers unmotivated to stop. The formative development of the VR scenario will be informed by the Medical Research Council’s guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions. The project will take a person-based approach, which aims to ground the intervention in a deep understanding of the perspectives of people who will eventually use it. A person-based approach helps ensure that the resulting intervention is usable, engaging, effective and will have high uptake."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As emerging adults, it is common for university students to experience substantial changes to their living conditions, relationships and mental health (e.g., increased academic stress). In addition to any ‘normal’ changes to university students’ living situations in Sweden and beyond, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted people’s lives through, for example, prolonged periods of behavioural restrictions limiting physical interactions with family, peers and teachers.\nFunded by the Swedish Public Health Authority (“Folkhälsomyndigheten”) and led by Prof. Anne Berman (Uppsala University) and Dr. Claes Andersson (Malmö University), this longitudinal survey study forms part of the larger World Health Organisation World Mental Health International College Student Initiative (WHO-WMH-ICS). As part of this project, we’re examining i) the trajectory of mental wellbeing in Swedish university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and ii) students’ interest in and uptake of psychological treatment."
