This website is used for the dissemination of the project findings, including links to scientific publications, presentations and videos.\n\nBrief project summary\nThe EU-funded project, COMPLAPSE, developed a formal and computational model of smoking lapse and relapse. We combined scientific theory, patient perspectives, and clinical know-how. The model, available as an interactive web app, can be used to simulate relapse risk and inform personalised, evidence-based digital cessation strategies.\nDiscover how COMPLAPSE is turning complexity into actionable insights for public health.\nWatch the video (produced by Booster):\n\n\n\n\nAims and objectives\nCigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in Europe and beyond. Gold standard treatment for smoking cessation includes pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. However, smoking lapses – influenced by momentary fluctuations in cigarette availability, stress, and cravings – are a key source of treatment failure. COMPLAPSE aims to advance the state-of-the-art by developing and validating a formal, dynamical systems model of lapse risk, improving the precision of static behaviour change theories to account for observed complexities and laying the foundation for dynamically tailored, person-centred digital smoking cessation interventions for increased effectiveness. COMPLAPSE is interdisciplinary in scope – drawing on know-how from behavioural science, systems science and dynamical systems modelling – and directly contributes to Europe’s Path to the Digital Decade and its Strategic Framework for the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases. COMPLAPSE aims to address the following Research and Innovation Objectives (ROIs), with each ROI associated with a dedicated Work Package (WP):\nROI1. To develop a conceptual model of lapse risk, drawing on stakeholder input and the researcher’s knowledge of the available literature via participatory systems mapping (WP1).\nROI2. To formulate mathematical equations for each component in the conceptual model and conduct a series of computer simulations (WP2).\nROI3. To collect and analyse EMA and sensor data and use this to validate the expert-derived dynamic computational model (WP3).\n\n\nWP1\nTheories are needed to predict, explain, and influence phenomena of interest. Popular relapse prevention theories are vaguely specified using natural language descriptions and lack temporal information about how key phenomena (i.e., ‘relapse’, ‘prolapse’, ‘abstinence’) are dynamically caused over time and within individuals. Formal modelling involves the translation of a theory’s structure into a mathematical framework and can help mitigate the ongoing ‘theory crisis’ in psychology and related disciplines, which contributes to the wider reproducibility crisis.\n\nThe aim of WP1 was to develop a conceptual model of lapse risk in smokers attempting to stop, with a view to using this to formulate a formal and computational model. However, due to the lack of fit-for-purpose methodological guidance, we first conducted a scoping review to examine the extent and nature of research activities pertaining to the use of formal and computational modelling to predict, explain and influence health behaviours unfolding at the within-person level. We synthesised methodological steps in the published literature and generated a set of initial, expert-derived ‘best practice’ modelling recommendations.\nIn addition, since formal and computational modelling has been used for decades in other scientific disciplines, we also took a broader perspective and conducted another scoping review in which we synthesised modelling guidance from diverse disciplines (e.g., psychology, engineering, biology, physics). The two scoping reviews (and the ongoing discussions with the involved interdisciplinary researchers) informed the next steps of our research.\nAfter conducting the scoping reviews, we drew on the Theory Construction Methodology to develop a dynamic model of smoking lapse and relapse. We used a participatory, multi-method approach to iteratively develop the conceptual model (also referred to as a ‘prototheory’), which included: i) an informal theory review of popular lapse and relapse theories; and ii) two linked stakeholder interviews with researchers, people with lived experience, stop smoking practitioners, and policymakers (N = 15).\n\n\n\n\nWP2\nNext, we translated the prototheory into a series of difference equations which were implemented in R code and an R Shiny application, which enables interested users to explore the dynamic model on their own. We conducted a series of computer simulations to examine if the formal and computational model could produce the empirical phenomena which it set out to explain (i.e., ‘relapse’, ‘prolapse’, ‘abstinence’). The stakeholders were invited back to provide feedback on the simulated model outputs. Their feedback was incorporated into an updated model version. A paper describing the development and initial evaluation of the formal and computational model of lapse risk has been submitted for publication and is available as a pre-print.\n\nWe also wrote a magazine article to describe how we worked together - integrating know-how from health psychology and mathematics/modelling - to translate the prototheory into a formal and computational model:\n\n\n\nWP3\nIn the final stage of project COMPLAPSE, we are collecting EMA and smartwatch data to empirically evaluate the dynamic model of lapse and relapse. Data collection is still ongoing. We will fit the formal model to the data from each participant and calculate goodness-of-fit statistics."

    "text": "During the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022), I co-led a living review (updated 12 times, with version 7 published in a peer-reviewed journal) of evidence on the association of smoking status with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality. Each update was shared directly with Public Health England’s tobacco control team and the charitable organisation Action on Smoking & Health. We found that compared with never smokers, current smokers appeared to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased risk of greater in-hospital disease severity, while former smokers appeared to be at increased risk of hospitalisation, greater in-hospital disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal.\nI co-led a case-control study at a UK hospital site to examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous. We found that in a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR-medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.\nI also contributed to a large survey study to gain a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on smoking, vaping and alcohol consumption among UK adults. We found that among UK adults, self-reported diagnosed/suspected COVID-19 was not associated with vaping status. Half of current vapers reported changing their vaping consumption since the COVID-19 outbreak, with the majority reporting an increase, and a minority was motivated to quit due to COVID-19.\nI also led a rapid review and meta-analysis of interventions to increase personal protective behaviours to limit the spread of respiratory viruses. We identified 39 studies conducted across 15 countries. We found low-quality evidence for positive effects of interventions targeting hand hygiene, with unclear results for interventions targeting face mask use. There was a lack of evidence for most behaviours of interest within this review.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Unsplash"

    "text": "The aim of the EMASENS project is to develop a smartphone-based stop smoking tool which provides personalised support to smokers in real-time, when they most need it (i.e., a ‘just-in-time adaptive intervention’). To provide such personalised support, we first need to understand when to send support and what type of support to send. \n\n\n\nPhoto by Unsplash\n\n\n\nIn the first stage of the EMASENS project, we aimed to gain a better understanding of when and why people are at risk of lapsing (i.e., smoking cigarettes after the quit date). To build a lapse prediction algorithm, we triangulated findings from two studies using slightly different approaches.\nIn the first study, we used observational data from a popular smoking cessation app to develop supervised machine learning algorithms to distinguish lapse from non-lapse reports. We used data from app users with ≥20 unprompted data entries, which included information about craving severity, mood, activity, social context, and lapse incidence. A series of group-level supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained and tested. Their ability to classify lapses for out-of-sample i) observations and ii) individuals were evaluated. Next, a series of individual-level and hybrid algorithms were trained and tested. We found that using unprompted app data appeared feasible for constructing a high-performing group-level lapse classification algorithm but its performance was variable when applied to unseen individuals. Algorithms trained on each individual’s dataset, in addition to hybrid algorithms trained on the group plus a proportion of each individual’s data, had improved performance but could only be constructed for a minority of participants. We therefore deemed it important to repeat the analyses using data from a prompted study design (using both signal- and event-contingent Ecological Momentary Assessments), with results triangulated with those from the present study to arrive at a better understanding of when and why lapses occur.\nIn the second study, we used self-reported data from brief, hourly surveys sent directly to people’s smartphones in addition to passively collected data from smartwatches to train and test group-level, individual-level, and hybrid (i.e., a combination of group- and individual-level) lapse prediction algorithms. We found that individual-level and hybrid algorithms performed better than the group-level algorithms, particularly when including the passively collected sensor data. However, multiple success criteria (e.g., acceptability, scalability, technical feasibility) need to be carefully balanced against algorithm performance in the JITAI development and implementation process.\nThe key output from the first stage of the EMASENS project was the selection of a best-performing algorithm to take forwards to underpin a smoking cessation JITAI.\nIn the second stage of the EMASENS project, we will develop the intervention messages using theory and behaviour change tools (e.g., the Behaviour Change Wheel) in combination with extensive user testing. A bank of intervention messages will be developed, tailored to each identified lapse risk factor. Next, the effectiveness of the JITAI will be evaluated. The second stage of the EMASENS project forms part of Corinna Leppin’s PhD project."

In collaboration with an international team of researchers (Dr. Dominika Kwasnicka, Dr. Jan Keller, Dr. Dimitra Kale, Bernard Yeboah-Asiamah Asare, Verena Schneider, Daniel Powell, Felix Naughton, Gill ten Hoor, Peter Verboon), I co-led a large systematic review of EMA studies of five public health-related behaviours, including tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, dietary behaviour and sexual health behaviour. The study protocol was pre-registered and the data and R code are openly available via GitHub.\nWe included 633 studies. The median study duration was 14 days. The most frequently assessed predictors were ‘negative feeling states’ (21%) and ‘motivation and goals’ (16.5%). The pooled percentage of EMA adherence was high at 81.4% (95% CI = 80.0%, 82.8%, k = 348) and did not differ by target behaviour but was somewhat higher in student (vs. general population) samples, when EMAs were delivered via mobile phones/smartphones (vs. handheld devices), and when event contingent (vs. fixed) sampling was used. This review showcases how the EMA method has been applied to improve understanding and prediction of health behaviours in context.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this large, overarching review, a series of behaviour-specific sub-reviews have also been planned/completed. I led the sub-review focused on tobacco smoking. More specifically, we examined within-person associations between psychological and contextual factors and lapse incidence in smokers attempting to stop. We included 56 studies, with 18 studies contributing 1+ effect sizes to the meta-analyses. In smokers attempting to stop, environmental and social cues and cravings appear to be key within-person antecedents of smoking lapse incidence."

    "text": "I first became interested in the problem of engagement with digital behaviour change interventions when studying for an MSc in Health Psychology at UCL (2014-2015). In my dissertation, I explored patterns of users’ engagement with a novel smoking cessation app, BupaQuit.\nMy PhD thesis (2015-2018) - supervised by Prof. Susan Michie, Prof. Ann Blandford and Prof. Robert West - comprised 6 studies and aimed to gain a better understanding of how to define, measure and promote engagement with digital interventions in general, and with apps for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction in particular. As part of this work, we conducted an interdisciplinary, systematic review and generated a two-part, integrative definition of digital engagement and a conceptual framework. We used semi-structured interviews and online surveys to develop a self-report measure of digital engagement and evaluated the new measure in two different populations. We also conducted a think aloud and interview study and a focus group study to gain a better understanding of factors that influence engagement with apps for smoking cessation alcohol reduction, in addition to a series of N-of-1 studies, harnessing smartphone-enabled daily ecological momentary assessments, to explore within-person fluctuations in psychological and behavioural variables (e.g. motivation, extent of alcohol consumption) and their associations with users’ app engagement.\n\n\n\nRelated to this work, in collaboration with Prof. Jonathan Bricker (Fred Hutch Cancer Center) and colleagues, we explored patterns of user engagement with websites and apps for smoking cessation, using unsupervised machine learning techniques including sequence and cluster analysis. For example, we found that WebQuit users could be categorized into Disengagers, Tryers, and Committers based on their qualitatively different content usage patterns. Committers saw increases in a key mechanism of action and had greater odds of quit success.\nIn a piece collaboratively written with Dr. Camille Short (University of Melbourne), we reflected on the concept of acceptability in digital health research and how it relates to user engagement. We conducted a narrative review of theoretical and empirical examples from the literature. First, we argue that acceptability may usefully be considered an emergent property of a complex, adaptive system of interacting components (e.g., affective attitude, beliefs), which in turn influences (and is influenced by) user engagement. Second, acceptability is important due to its ability to predict and explain key outcomes of interest, including user engagement and intervention effectiveness. Third, precisely what people find acceptable is deeply contextualized and interlinked with prevailing social and cultural norms. Understanding and designing for such norms (e.g., through drawing on principles of user centered design) is therefore key. Finally, there is a lack of standard acceptability measures and thresholds. Star ratings coupled with free-text responses may provide a pragmatic means of capturing acceptability.\nFollowing this work, I’ve become increasingly persuaded that emerging technologies (e.g. chatbots, virtual reality) and novel intervention designs (e.g. hybrid human-digital interventions, ‘just-in-time adaptive interventions’) have potential for counteracting the observed ‘engagement crisis’. In collaboration with Dr. David Crane (architect of the Smoke Free app), we conducted an experimental study with >55,000 smokers to examine the added effect of a supportive chatbot on user engagement and short-term quit success. The results were positive, with the addition of the chatbot more than doubling rates of engagement and increasing self-reported quit success at a 1-month follow-up. Together with Alice Alphonse and Kezia Stewart (MSc Behaviour Change, UCL), we subsequently conducted a qualitative study to explore the potential mechanism(s) underpinning this increased user engagement. We found that anthropomorphism of the quick-response chatbot appeared to be enabled by its interaction style and format and users’ perceived need for support, which may have given rise to feelings of accountability and increased engagement."

Tools to support health promotion are increasingly developed using digital technologies, allowing them to be more dynamic and situated than was possible with older media and facilitating reuse of tool components. At the same time, opportunities for reuse are limited by tools being insufficiently documented, findable, accessible, interoperable, or licensed insufficiently permissively. To avoid waste of public funds, it would be beneficial if there were an open, public database of digital health tools. This would help researchers, prevention professionals, policymakers, and healthcare workers to identify available technologies and explore the evidence for their effectiveness. To populate a first version of such a database, we will conduct a living review of digital health tools.\nDeciding which entities to extract and how each entity will be extracted (e.g., categories, coding instructions) is an important first step in developing this living review. Given the weight of this decision, combined with the multidisciplinary nature of the review topic, it is important to base the decision on expertise from a wide range of scientific disciplines (e.g., behavioural science, computer science, human-computer interaction) and geographic regions. Therefore, we will use a procedure that combines elements of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and the Delphi method to leverage expertise from a group of experts and transparently base the decisions on this information. This approach combines the best of two worlds: asynchronous pooling of expertise and a transparent and systematic decision procedure.\nWe will use successive rounds where the “participants” (i.e., expert collaborators) provide information, interact with information prepared beforehand or provided in earlier rounds, and provide ratings. The procedure for deciding which entities to extract has been pre-registered.\nThe results from the project (publicised after each consecutive round) are openly available on GitLab."

Following user testing but prior to conducting a large-scale randomised controlled trial, we considered it important to conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of recruitment and acceptability of the VR scenario. Although the target sample size was not achieved within our feasibility window, an amendment to gift inexpensive headsets via post appeared feasible. The brief VR scenario appeared acceptable to smokers unmotivated to quit; however, we concluded that future work would benefit from optimising the VR scenario prior to conducting a larger-scale study.\nTosan Okpako joined the project in October 2022. As part of her PhD, Tosan will lead the development of an immersive VR scenario to increase motivation in smokers unmotivated to stop. The formative development of the VR scenario will be informed by the Medical Research Council’s guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions.

The project conceptualises addictive behaviours as dynamical systems that evolve non-linearly over time and within individuals. Through collecting and modelling high-resolution data from smartphones and smartwatches in the daily life, Time Matters will develop an adaptive algorithm capable of delivering the right type of support to each person, when and where they most need it. In doing so, the project will provide a new framework for understanding and preventing relapse across the addictions.\n\n\nNews\nI’ll soon be hiring several team members - stay tuned for job postings!"

    "text": "We regularly run studies to better understand how to support individuals with addictive behaviours. By taking part, you will be contributing to research that aims to improve people’s health and wellbeing and help develop new treatments and tools.\nOn this page, you will find a list of studies which are currently open. For each study, you will find information about:\n\nWhat the study is about\nWho can take part\nWhat participation involves\nHow to sign up\n\n\nPilot study: Using control systems engineering in smoking cessation to optimise a just-in-time adaptive intervention for relapse prevention\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the study about?\nCigarette smoking leads to illness and premature death. The best thing you can do for your health is to quit smoking, but it is difficult and the risk of relapse is high. Studies using mobile phones and smartwatches to measure various risk factors in the daily life show that smoking cessation is a dynamic process. Therefore, relapse prevention efforts need to have the ability to deliver the right type of psychological support to each individual, when and where they need it most (“just-in-time”).\nThis interdisciplinary project aims to develop dynamic models that describe the mechanisms underlying lapse and relapse when trying to quit smoking. A further aim is to investigate what type of psychological support is optimal for preventing relapse, for application in a future individually tailored “just-in-time adaptive intervention”.\n\n\nWho can take part?\nYou can take part if:\n\nYou are over 18 years of age\nYou live in Sweden and can speak, read and write in Swedish or English\nYou smoke cigarettes daily\nYou are willing to set a date to quit smoking (which means that you will try to never smoke a cigarette again)\nYou are willing to wear a smartwatch (which will be loaned to you) and answer short, daily smartphone surveys for 28 days\n\nYou cannot take part if:\n\nYou have a history of arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation)\nYou regularly take beta-blockers (e.g. atenolol, bisoprolol)\nYou have an implanted cardiac device\n\n\n\nWhat does participation involve?\nIf you decide to take part, you will first give consent and complete an online questionnaire about your age and smoking patterns. If you are eligible, you will be invited to an online video call with a researcher where we will explain the study, show you how the apps and smartwatch work, and ask you to set a quit date.\nYou will then receive a smartwatch by post. From your quit date, you will wear the watch and complete short smartphone surveys (2–3 minutes each) several times a day for 28 days. You will also receive brief supportive messages (“microinterventions”).\nAt the end of the 28 days, you will be asked to complete a short survey about your experiences.\n\n\nHow do I sign up?\nIf you are interested in participating in the study, please read the participant information sheet and complete the screening survey to register your interest and check if you are eligible to take part.\n\n\n\nPilotstudie: Tillämpning av kontrollsystemteknik inom rökavvänjning för att optimera en återfallsförebyggande “just-in-time” adaptiv intervention”\n\n\n\n\nVad är det för ett projekt?\nCigarettrökning leder till sjukdom och förtidig död. Det bästa man kan göra för sin hälsa är att sluta röka men det är svårt och återfallsrisken är stor. Studier som använt mobiltelefoner och smarta klockor för att mäta olika riskfaktorer i det dagliga livet visar att rökavvänjning är en dynamisk process. Därför behöver återfallsförebyggande insatser ha förmågan att leverera rätt typ av psykologiskt stöd till varje enskild individ, när och var de mest behöver det (”just-in-time”).\nDet här tvärvetenskapliga projektet har som mål att utveckla dynamiska modeller som beskriver de mekanismer som ligger till grund för återfall när man försöker sluta röka. Ytterligare ett mål är att undersöka vilken typ av psykologiskt stöd som är optimalt för att förebygga återfall, för tillämpning i en framtida individanpassad ”just-in-time” adaptiv intervention.\n\n\nVem kan delta?\nDu kan delta i studien om:\n\nDu är över 18 år gammal\nDu bor i Sverige och kan tala, läsa och skriva på svenska eller engelska\nDu röker cigaretter dagligen\nDu är villig att sätta ett datum för rökstopp (vilket betyder att du kommer att försöka att aldrig mer röka en cigarett)\nDu är villig att ha på dig en smartklocka och svara på korta, dagliga smartphoneenkäter under 28 dagar\n\nDu kan inte delta om:\n\nDu har en historia av arytmier (t.ex. förmaksflimmer)\nDu regelbundet tar betablockerare (t.ex. atenolol, bisoprolol)\nDu har en implanterad hjärtrytmenhet\n\n\n\nVad innebär deltagandet?\nOm du väljer att delta kommer du först att ge ditt samtycke och fylla i ett webbaserat frågeformulär om din ålder och dina rökvanor. Om du är berättigad att delta i studien blir du inbjuden till ett kort videomöte med en forskare, där vi visar hur apparna och smartklockan fungerar samt ber dig att sätta ett datum för ditt rökstopp.\nDärefter får du en smartklocka hemskickad. Från och med datumet för rökstoppet kommer du att ha på dig klockan och besvara korta enkäter i din mobiltelefon (2–3 minuter vardera) flera gånger per dag under 28 dagar. Du kommer också att få korta stödmeddelanden (“mikrointerventioner”) via din mobiltelefon.\nEfter de 28 dagarna ombeds du att fylla i en kort enkät om dina erfarenheter av att delta i studien.\n\n\nHur anmäler jag mig?\nOm du är intresserad av att delta i studien, läs igenom informationen till forskningspersoner och fyll i screeningenkäten för att anmäla ditt intresse och se om du är berättigad att delta."
