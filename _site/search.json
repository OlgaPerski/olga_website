    "text": "I’m an interdisciplinary researcher and practitioner health psychologist working at the intersection of behavioural science and technology. My research is focused on the development, optimisation and evaluation of interventions for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction delivered via smartphone apps, chatbots and virtual reality. I’m interested in the technology-enabled, real-time assessment and modelling of within-person processes and ‘just-in-time adaptive interventions’.\nI’m an advocate of Open Science. I act as Co-Director for the Open Digital Health initiative, which aims to enable the scaling and sharing of evidence-informed digital health tools.\n\nBrief bio\n\nI completed my PhD in Health Psychology at University College London (UK) in 2018, with a thesis focused on the definition, measurement and promotion of user engagement with digital behaviour change interventions.\nAfter completing my PhD, I worked as a Research Fellow (2018-2021) and subsequently as a Senior Research Fellow (2021-2022) in the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group (UK).\nIn 2022, I was awarded a 3-year MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship funded by the European Commission to work on the [COMPLAPSE]( “COMPLAPSE”) project. During my fellowship, I will spend two years in the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science at the University of California, San Diego (USA) and one year in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Tampere University (Finland).\nFor an updated list of my publications, please visit my Google Scholar page."

    "text": "I have produced an evidence review written for the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which was subsequently used to inform Public Health England’s (PHE) statement on smoking and COVID-19. Public Health England subsequently requested that the RCP review be converted into a living review. The review has since been updated 12 times, with the manuscript shared with PHE’s ‘tobacco and smoking cell’ directly and updated on a preprint server (with v7 published in a peer-reviewed journal). PHE referred to the review in response to a parliamentary question on smoking and COVID-19.\nI was invited, alongside members of the UK SPI-B, to provide expert input into the development of the UK coronavirus contact tracing app.\nI have contributed to health and technology policy formation by leading the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change’s submission to NICE’s consultation in preparation for updating their guideline on behaviour change to incorporate evidence on digital behaviour change interventions. In 2019, I provided academic stakeholder input into NICE’s Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies. In 2020, I was invited to provide input into the WHO–ITU mHealth Hub in EU’s ‘Knowledge Tool 1: Assessment Frameworks in mHealth’."

    "text": "Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in Europe and beyond. Gold standard treatment for smoking cessation includes pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. However, smoking lapses – influenced by momentary fluctuations in cigarette availability, stress, and cravings – are a key source of treatment failure. COMPLAPSE aims to advance the state-of-the-art by developing and validating a dynamic systems model of lapse risk, improving the precision of static behaviour change theories to account for observed complexities and laying the foundation for dynamically tailored, person-centred digital smoking cessation interventions for increased effectiveness. COMPLAPSE is interdisciplinary in scope – drawing on know-how from behavioural science, engineering, and computer science – and directly contributes to Europe’s Path to the Digital Decade and its Strategic Framework for the Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases. First, a conceptual model will be developed by articulating a diverse group of collaborators’ (i.e., researchers, policymakers, practitioners, smokers) dynamic predictions through participatory systems mapping. Next, a computational model will be developed through formulating mathematical equations for each model component, followed by a series of computer simulations to iteratively refine the model to align with the collaborators’ predictions. Finally, the model will be validated against temporally dense experience sampling and sensor data collected in smokers’ daily lives across different geographies to critically examine whether the computational model outperforms state-of-the-art behaviour change theories. The outputs from COMPLAPSE are expected to act as a robust starting point for the development of dynamically tailored and person-centred smoking cessation interventions, enabled by digital technologies, such as smartphone apps and wearable sensors that are ubiquitous in both high- and low-income settings.\nCOMPLAPSE is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme (HORIZON), Grant No. 101065293. COMPLAPSE is led by Dr. Olga Perski and supported by Prof. Nelli Hankonen (Tampere University), Prof. Eric Hekler (University of California, San Diego) and Prof. Misha Pavel (Northeastern University).\nThe data and analytical code underpinning the analyses in COMPLAPSE will be made openly available via GitHub in due course."
