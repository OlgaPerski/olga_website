## Digital health start-ups

In 2014-2015, I worked with the mental wellbeing smartphone app Remente (Gothenburg, Sweden) to optimise their intervention messages.

In 2017, I worked with Smart Peak Flow Ltd (London, UK) to optimise the intervention messages provided as part of a smartphone app and a linked smart device to measure the peak expiratory flow rate in adults with asthma.

In 2019, as part of the 'Research to Venture Mental Health Programme' funded by the Wellcome Trust (UK), I worked with Adia Health Ltd (now transformed into Parla Ltd) to conduct a mixed-methods pilot evaluation of a digital platform to support women's physical and mental preconception health.

In 2020, I worked with ONKO Health (London, UK) to advise on the number and wording of survey items and feedback messages to use as part of a cancer support smartphone app.
